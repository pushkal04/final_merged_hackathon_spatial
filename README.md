## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional financial terminals confine high-dimensional financial data—such as order book depth, cross-asset contagion vectors, and systemic liquidity movements—into dense, flat 2D screens. Traders suffer from:
- **Screen Real Estate Congestion:** Constant tab switching between candlestick charts, Depth of Market (DOM) ladders, risk desks, and macro feeds.
- **Abstract Depth Perception:** Flat 2D order book ladders make it difficult to quickly gauge resting liquidity walls and hidden buy/sell pressure.
- **Loss of Floor Dynamics:** Electronic trading isolated market participants, losing the intuitive spatial and auditory cues once present on open outcry exchange floors.
- **Complex Macro Contagion Assessment:** Calculating systemic margin headroom and cross-asset contagion (e.g., how a 50bp Fed rate hike or Crude Oil spike cascades into equity and crypto collateral) is typically slow and difficult to model interactively.

## 🚀 Solution & Core Features

The Spatial Workstation leverages spatial computing in visionOS to solve these problems by projecting modular, interactive 3D trading workspaces into the user's physical environment:

### 1. Spatial Launchpad Hub
- Central launch console designed with visionOS glassmorphism.
- Spawns modular sub-workspaces as independent, floating 3D windows that can be positioned side-by-side in panoramic multi-window trading desks.

### 2. Spatial Workstation Desk (Window #1)
- **Live Candlestick Charting:** Multi-timeframe candlestick feeds (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h) with real-time VWAP and SMA 20 overlays.
- **Level 2 Depth of Market (DOM):** Interactive bid/ask order ladder with dynamic spread monitoring and real-time order imbalance meters.
- **3D Order Depth Landscape (Three.js):** 3D bar chart visualizing resting buy pressure walls (Emerald) vs. sell ask walls (Rose) in orbital 3D space.
- **Aggressive Time & Sales Tape:** Live transaction tape identifying aggressive market orders and liquidity sweeps.
- **Execution & Portfolio Desk:** Direct order submission (Limit, Market, Stop) with real-time initial margin calculations and unrealized PnL tracking.

### 3. Educational 3D Open Outcry Trading Pit (Window #2)
- **Auction Market Theory (AMT) Simulator:** An active training ground for institutional desks and junior traders to study liquidity fragmentation under localized auction stress.
- **Microstructure Playback Mode:** Replays historical market anomalies (e.g., the 2010 Flash Crash or liquidity vacuums) where avatars translate complex tape speed and order book exhaustion into physical spatial cues (shouting volume, pitch frequency, and aggressive gesture pacing).
- **Interactive Hand-Signal Lab:** Trainees use visionOS hand-tracking gestures to match simulated block orders using traditional pit signals, scoring execution slippage against algorithmic benchmarks.
- **Spatial Audio Engine:** Web Audio synthesis featuring shout order sound effects, gavel strikes, and an optional ambient pit crowd murmur toggle.

### 4. Cross-Asset Macro Shockwave Matrix (Window #3)
- **Vector Contagion Canvas:** Real-time vector node graph representing correlated asset classes (`/ES`, `/NQ`, `/BTC`, `/CL`, `/GC`, `/ZN`).
- **Interactive Shock Detonation:** Trigger systemic shocks or quick presets (Fed Rate Spike, Geopolitical Oil Shock, Tech Selloff) to watch animated energy shockwaves and directional particle flows propagate across assets.
- **Cross-Asset Elasticity Matrix:** Computes empirical beta ($\beta$) transfers and projected price variations.
- **Systemic Margin Call & Collateral Stress Tester:** Calculates stressed margin requirements and dynamic Free Collateral Headroom gauges.

### 5. Spatial Volatility Explorer (Window #4)
- **3D Implied Volatility Mesh:** Integrates advanced surface plots mapping Strike vs. Expiration vs. Implied Volatility in real time.
- **Greeks Risk Heatmaps:** Floating volumetric heatmaps displaying Delta, Gamma, and Vega risk distribution across option chains, allowing risk managers to visually spot volatility skew distortions and tail-risk exposures.
- **Interactive Strike Pinching:** Pinch and pull individual nodes on the volatility mesh to stress-test portfolio sensitivity under custom volatility shock scenarios.

### 🤖 Gemini Market Copilot
Built-in AI market assistant capable of analyzing order book imbalances, explaining systemic shock propagation, and advising on collateral haircut mitigation.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Native visionOS Shell (Swift / SwiftUI):**
  - Manages multi-window lifecycles using `WindowGroup(id:)` for `hub`, `workstation`, `pit`, `shockwave`, and `volatility`.
  - Renders native visionOS top control ornaments (`.ornament`) with branding, return-to-hub triggers, maximize toggles, and window dismissal buttons.
  - Native `.glassBackgroundEffect()` and unobstructed safe-area padding allowing visionOS window grab bars to move freely.
- **JavaScript-to-Swift Bridge (`WKScriptMessageHandler`):**
  - Seamless message channel allowing web buttons to trigger native visionOS `openWindow(id:)` and `dismissWindow()`.
- **Graphics & Audio Engine:**
  - **Three.js (r128):** High-performance 3D rendering for the Order Depth Landscape, Open Outcry Pit arena, and Implied Volatility Mesh surfaces.
  - **HTML5 Canvas 2D:** Responsive candlestick rendering and vector contagion flow simulations.
  - **Web Audio API:** Synthesized procedural sound effects and spatial ambience.

## 🛠️ How to Run & Build

### Prerequisites
* **macOS**: Sonoma 14.0 or later
* **Xcode**: Xcode 15.2 or later (with the **visionOS SDK** installed via *Xcode > Settings > Platforms*)

---

### Method A: Running in the visionOS Simulator

1. **Open the Project in Xcode**:
   * Open your `.xcodeproj` or create a new **visionOS > App** project in Xcode.
   * Add `Spatial_WorkstationApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, and `WebViewContainer.swift` to your Xcode project target.
   * Drag `index.html` into your Xcode project navigator (ensure **"Copy items if needed"** and your app target are checked).
